The aim of my own development is to design and implement an innovative, user-friendly website that will initially be made available for private use and, in the long term, to the public. The platform is aimed at archers and aims to significantly simplify and improve the training and analysis process through the use of modern image processing technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).

At the heart of the development is a secure log-in system that enables access to individual user profiles. Here, users can manage their training data in a secure and structured manner. The main focus is on an intelligent image processing function: a camera interface is used to automatically capture, analyze and save the shooter's hit image. The image processing technology extracts the position and value of the hits and merges the data into comprehensive hit statistics. The results are documented in tabular form and in specified forms, providing the user with a transparent and clear record of their performance.

In the extended development phase, the integration of an AI-supported analysis module is planned. This module will generate targeted suggestions for the user's individual sighting and technique optimization based on the recorded hit images. This will provide the archer with valuable support to continuously improve their skills, as the AI works on a learning basis and adapts to the individual training progress and results.

This website creates a comprehensive digital platform for archers that not only serves as a personal training and analysis tool, but also offers the potential to take archery to a new technological level in the long term.
